    <h2>This authentic spaghetti carbonara made the traditional Italian way proves that
        simplicity proves magnificent.</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that’s so creamy, you’d swear there’s
        a good amount of cream in it. And indeed, there’s plenty of recipes that cheat by adding
        in cream. But today, we’re making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional
        way. No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.</p>
    <p>Carbonara calls for raw eggs which are stirred vigorously off the stove with hot cooked
        pasta, guanciale (a cured pork like bacon), parmesan and a splash of pasta cooking water.
        Watch the magic unfold before your eyes as 4 simple ingredients transforms into a luxurious
        creamy sauce! NO CREAM allowed!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 oz guanciale</li>
        <li>2 lrg eggs</li>
        <li>3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano <em>finely shredded</em></li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>14 oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove <em>finely minced</em></li>
        <h4>For Garnish</h4>
        <li>Parsley <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        <li>Parmigiano reggiano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut guanciale into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li> Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir
            in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add
            pasta and cook per the packet directions. Just before draining, scoop
            out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium
            high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the
            guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using
            garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li>Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg.
            Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of
            a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to
            creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra
            parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped
            parsley.</li>
    </ol>
